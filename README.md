This project is one of my first attempts at web development coming from an electronics engineering background. Whilst completing it, I was developing my familiarity in using CSS / Javascript frameworks such as Vite, React, Three.JS and Tailwind. It was really interesting, for me at least, working with rendering 3D objects in websites as I did not know at the time that such a thing was even possible
